# Using APIs in Python

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Be able to use GET and POST methods of Rest APIs using Python.

_Requirements:_ Replit

_Language used:_ Python

_Customization opportunity:_ You can build any project using APIs in Python. You can use any API of your choice. Example: A project that uses the Twitter API to post tweets, a project that uses the Google Maps API to find the distance between two places, a project that uses Dictionary API, Weather API etc. Possiblilies are endless. I will be using the Dictionary API in this workshop and also provide a list of interesting APIs for jammers to work with that can be used to build cool projects.

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based Replit Development

_Time estimation:_ 1 hour

### Breakdown
- Set up: Create a new replit python project 
- Part 1: Setup an API key with a website of your choice and get the API key
- Part 2: Write code to interact with the API
- Part 3: Write code to parse and use returned API data
- Success!!! Now you've got a working API call in Python

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
### - Introduce to them the idea of APIs, how commonly they're used and how they can be used to build cool projects of any sort and interact with websites of their choice. Jammers can use the API of a website of their choice and build a project associated with it. Example: Check the weather in a city. Find the synonyms of a word etc.
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
### - APIs are used everywhere. They are used to interact with websites, create projects, automate tasks etc. They are very useful and can be used to build cool projects. I've worked with several APIs before including Twitter, Spotify, Discord and several others than can help fetch data from websites while teaching you how to use APIs.
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
### - Quick Introduction of API and its applications and list of most commonly used and interesting APIs. (5 mins)
### - Walkthrough of setting up Python project on Replit. (5 mins)
### - Walkthrough of setting up API key with a website of your choice. (5 mins)
### - Walkthrough of project steps with live coding. (25 mins)
### - Independent work, customization, and problem-solving time. (15 mins)
### - Sharing of projects and ideas with other club members. (5 mins)

- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
### - Knowledge of how to use APIs in Python, a project that uses APIs.
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
### - They can build any project of their choice using APIs. Endless possibilies of customization.
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
### - Browser-based Replit Development only
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
### - Club Leaders can build anything of their choice due to the possiblities of customization. They can interact with Spotify, News Sources, GitHub etc. We can also include interesting and successful projects created by Club leaders around the world. I will be using the Dictionary API in this workshop and also provide a list of interesting APIs for jammers to work with that can be used to build projects that interest them.
